# Federated-Learning-with-Dataset-Condensation

Abstract:
To increase the security in a Federated Learning environment this work proposes a
combination of Federated Learning with Dataset Condensation. A technique to synthesize
the information of a large dataset into a smaller dataset. We evaluate federatedtrained
models with and without Dataset Condensation with good performance but
not similar accurate results. Further, we compare the accuracy of the proposed algorithm
with Dataset Condensation with Differentiable Siamese Augmentation in a nonfederated
environment. And conclude that Dataset Condensation performs similarly
in both environments.
